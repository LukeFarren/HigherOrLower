### I.0 Initiative

Build a game with C++ or C in which the computer presents a number between 1 and 10, the player then guesses if the next number to be presented is either higher or lower. 

### 2.0 Epics and User Stories

##### Epics
* One player game against a computer controlled AI.
* The computer presents a number between 1 and 10.
* The player inputs either lower or higher using L or H keys.
* The computer presents another number between 1 and 10 either higher or lower then the original number.
* The computer presents either you win or you lose or you draw.


##### Non-Functional Requirements

* A sentence asking if the user will pick higher or lower.
* A sentence stating rolling the dice.
* The computer displays a random number before the user in puts H or L
*  
* 


##### User Stories

* As a user, I want the game instructions to be clear.
* As a player, I would like the game to work.
* As a player,

Task 7 - Display L or H and ask to choose one. 
Task 6 - Have the computer roll a dice.
Task 8 - Display a number between 1 and 10 
Task 9 - if the number is < displayed number and you chose higher, you lose
Task 10 - if the number is > displayed number and your chose higher, you win. 
 Task 11 - if number is < displayed number and you chose lower, you win. 
Task - 12 - if number is > displayed number and you chose higher, you lose.
